URLS:


http://localhost:8080/catalogue/user/ - start page

http://localhost:8080/catalogue/user/get/0 - get user - works perfectly:)))

1. Used Annotation style
2. ORM (Hibernate part) - OK
3. Spring - OK
4. MVC - done:
    - model - OK
    - controller - ok
    - view - jsp pages and pagination borrowed, but I understand whole idea
5. Maven - OK, all clear
6. Project deploying - OK
7. GitHub integration idea IDE + command line + GitHub from MAC - OK

Open issues:
 - userList doesn't bind to JSP pages (can't fix) everything looks right... ((
 - pagination doesn't work because of issue 1
